#### PopularMovies 
This is my implementation of the Popular Movies project for the Udacity Android Developers nanodegree.

##### How to build
First and foremost, you will need to obtain an API key from the TMDB API: https://www.themoviedb.org
Following that, you will need to add a variable declaration in your gradle.properties file
Below is most of the source from my implementation, save the API Key.

```
tmdbApiKey="API KEY GOES HERE"

```

Following that, you should be able to build using Gradle and it should function.
